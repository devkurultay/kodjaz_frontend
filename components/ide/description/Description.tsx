        When printing things in Python, we are supplying a text block that we
        want to be printed. Text in Python is considered a specific type of data
        called a string. A string, so named because they’re a series of letters,
        numbers, or symbols connected in order — as if threaded together by
        string. Strings can be defined in different ways:
      </p>
    </div>
  );
